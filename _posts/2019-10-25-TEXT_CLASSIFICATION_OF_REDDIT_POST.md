The Data is scraped from Reddit.com. Two Sub-Reddits of my interest are Japan Travel and Japan Life. In this NLP(Natural Language Processing) project, Binary class classification is done to find the class of the subreddit post. Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier is used in the Final Model. This classification is done to improve customer satisfaction and to avoid missing of information related to a particular subreddit due to posting under wrong subreddit. Reddit will be able to move the post under right category using this classification model.
